      Over 7 years of experience working in marketing and operations management.
      Currently, I work as Mobi Warehousesâ€™ Marketing and Operations Manager,
      improving sales experiences and marketing to our valued customers by using
      digital and traditional marketing tools. My operational responsibilities
      include oversight of the procurement/sale of goods and delivery of
